Classification in neural networks with keras tuner is a flexible technique which is used as hyperparameter tuning for the choosing the desirable no. of filters, layers e.t.c 
This is a machine learning model which classifies 10 distinct fashion wears each of 28 x 28 gray-scale images, The dataset contains 60,000 images and 10,000 images for the test data .. which can be gotten from Kaggle.
